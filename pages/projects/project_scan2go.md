### About

The 3D HUMAN MODEL is used by designers and mechanical engineers to optimize the physical human-product interaction. The models provide a great overview of the statistical 1D data and make it easier to use the information in a 3D CAD environment. The models are based on existing data sets and scientifically validated. The development was done in conjunction with Dr. Johan F.M. Molenbroek, Associate Professor Applied Ergonomics at the Delft University of Technology and Humanetics Innovative Solutions.
