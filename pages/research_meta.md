The Metabolic Imaging group aims at developing robust and highly sensitive metabolic imaging methods at ultra-high field for application in clinical studies on cancer, brain disorders, metabolic disorders, cardiovascular disease and muscle (patho)physiology.

The MRS-group develops 1H, 2H, 31P, 13C, 19F and 23Na metabolic imaging methods in the brain and body for use at ultra-high field (7 Tesla) MR systems. We focus on fast and robust methods including image reconstruction and image analysis tools.

### Ongoing research projects

- MR imaging and metabolic imaging in adult and pediatric brain tumors
- MR imaging and spectroscopy of metabolism and mitochondrial function in metabolic disorders
- Functional metabolic imaging of cerebral physiology in brain disorders
